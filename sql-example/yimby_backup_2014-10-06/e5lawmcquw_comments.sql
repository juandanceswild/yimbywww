I thought it was recognized at this point that \'towers in the park\' are less than desirable, yet this is exactly what it appears we are getting.  I would have preferred:<br /><br />* breaking up the site with bona fide streets oriented in a grid-like pattern<br /><br />* Buildings of varying heights arranged to create street walls.  <br /><br />* Place the tallest towers (50-70 stories) at corners of the grid.  Shorter buildings (8-12 stories) on the other streets<br /><br />* Park space (which I do agree is important in this area) should have been placed either in its own block, surrounded by bona fide streets with buildings, or, if that was not practical, then park space should have been placed in some other very well-defined area, such as in the middle of a block of buildings.  You could have passageways mid-block leading to the park space. (Although one would have to be careful with the design in order to maximize visibility.)  In any event, park space should be designed as a \"room\" with \"walls.\"  Buildings shouldn\'t have \"front yards.\"<br /><br />* It would have been best to create a master plan and then divvy up the work on different parts of the plan to different architects.  Large complexes designed by single architects are aesthetically very risky.  I would encourage a site that will appear to blend into the streetscape and not appear to be a separate complex all its own.',0,'1','','',0,0),(4,491,'NikoV','noreply@blogger.com','http://www.blogger.com/profile/13260084966546691074','','2011-11-27 09:38:28','2011-11-27 09:38:28','I think your critique of the plan is valid, and different architects for the entire site would\'ve definitely been preferred, but the size of the plan negates the \'towers in the park\' aspect to a degree. <br /><br />Many of the failures of \'tower in park\' developments come--IMO--from the lack of overall density. You can have five 20-story towers over 4 acres, but that isn\'t terribly dense, and it\'s made worse by the open space.<br /><br />The scale of Hudson Yards is what will hopefully differentiate it from such developments. It will be very difficult for the area to be deserted when it will contain dozens of 50+ story buildings. I definitely agree that skyscraper \'front yards\' are undesirable, but the Hudson Yards plan calls for a boulevard running from (roughly) ten blocks, from 30th on north, that should be the backbone of the area. <br /><br />I really wish the site would have been broken up with streets, though. One of the greatest travesties in NYC is anything that deviates from the original grid, and it should be restored in full--including other sites in town, particularly the public housing developments (Stuy Town, etc).',0,'1','','',0,0),(5,425,'dannysganymedestuff','noreply@blogger.com','http://www.blogger.com/profile/05578223271534500091','','2012-04-13 05:01:46','2012-04-13 05:01:46','Lol the Displeased Union rat.<br />Great pics though, I\'m looking forward to how this ends up to look like.',0,'1','','',0,0),(6,417,'Andrew Fine','noreply@blogger.com','http://www.blogger.com/profile/11410776900972800733','','2012-04-18 13:14:41','2012-04-18 13:14:41','Yimby- Looks like great minds think alike!

The first, of course, is the height itself.  While the limits imposed on an individually zoned lot are set, a developer can literally buy the air rights from one adjoining lot to add to his development, so that the overall \"height\" for the set of adjoining lots is, sort of, fixed.  The lots have to be adjoining, so cannot take some from the place across the street.  It also diminishes the value of the adjoiners as they have typically sold their rights in perpetuity.<br /><br />The other factor is called FAR - floor to area ratio.  F\'rinstance, let\'s say you have a lot of 10,000 sf.  The maximum FAR is determined by the zoning, neighborhood to neighborhood.  A FAR of say 2 means your building cannot exceed 20,000 sf, i.e. two floors.  A FAR of 10 gives you up to 10 floors.  <br /><br />Between the height cap and the FAR, the overall volume of the building is basically set.  So, without knowing bupkiss about what is actually going on at 432, I would guess it is a combination of purchased air rights and FAR that defines it\'s very rectilinear shape; the maximum volume, with the most number of floors, that fit.  It is ultimately why just about every building in the city is a box, so as to maximize the utilization of a very expensive piece of real estate.<br /><br />Regarding the shadows on the park, I don\'t know what the zoning says.  Obviously the impact is different from a building in the northeast versus the southwest corner of the park.  I do know that One Bryant Park\'s envelope was, in part, determined by the shadow it would cast, thereby defining its unique shape.  That was designed according to the LEED guidelines which give points to appropriate shadow casting.',0,'1','','',27,0),(219,98,'Anonymous','noreply@blogger.com','','','2013-04-09 13:31:11','2013-04-09 13:31:11','I disagree.

Not certain, but I anticipate the new Marriotts at 1717 Broadway will have a rooftop space that could be great for this.
